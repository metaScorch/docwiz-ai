Add a checkbox in the Sidebar to toggle letterhead

Use registration details (logo, entity name, address, etc.) to create a professional letterhead

Insert the letterhead in markdown format at the top of the document

We’ll add two new columns to the user_documents table header_content (md of header) and display_header (booelan) -> we’ll display the header and render it on the top above the content column based on this boolean.  We also have to make changes to the tip tap editor and add extensions as required. https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/nodes/image 

Allow users to edit the letterhead like normal text
